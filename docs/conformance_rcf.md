# AWS SageMaker Conformance

`anomstream-core` enforces the documented AWS `SageMaker` hyperparameter
bounds at build time. Beyond these invariants the library does not
aim for bit-exact parity with
[aws/random-cut-forest-by-aws](https://github.com/aws/random-cut-forest-by-aws) —
feature evolution is driven by eBPFsentinel Enterprise needs.

Regression test: `tests/aws_conformance.rs` pins every row below.

Extensions beyond the AWS signature:

- `ForestBuilder::feature_scales([f64; D])` — per-dim pre-scaling
  applied before any hot-path call. `1 / stddev[d]` gives
  unit-variance normalisation without a separate caller pass.
- `ThresholdedForest` — adaptive threshold on top of the bare
  forest, inspired by AWS's `TRCF` in `randomcutforest-parkservices`
  but kept light (no short/long duality, no near-threshold
  heuristics). Builder `z_factor`, `min_threshold`,
  `min_observations`, `score_decay`. Two `ThresholdMode` variants:
  legacy `ZSigma { z_factor }` (`μ + z·σ` on EMA) or new
  `Quantile { p }` (streaming `TDigest` p99/p99.9) — the latter is
  the recommended path because isolation-depth scores are
  right-skewed, not Gaussian. Opt in via
  `ThresholdedForestBuilder::quantile_threshold(p)`.
- `forensic_baseline(&point)` — repurposes the AWS `ImputeVisitor`
  concept as a per-dim _"what would this have looked like under
  the live baseline?"_ SOC triage helper. Returns raw-space
  `expected / stddev / delta / zscore`.
- `score_early_term` — sequential early-termination scoring on
  converged per-tree means, cuts latency on easy points.
- `score_codisp` — probe-based codisp walk (insert → walk leaf
  → root accumulating `max(sibling.mass / subtree.mass)` per
  level → delete). Matches AWS Java / rrcf scoring semantic;
  ~25× slower than `score()` post the rayon-per-tree parallel
  walk + delete refactor. On NAB `realKnownCause` it lifts
  aggregate AUC 0.719 → 0.776. Mutates the reservoir per probe
  — known baseline drift on long streams, see
  `score_codisp_stateless`.
- `score_codisp_stateless` — non-mutating codisp estimate via
  root → leaf descent along stored cuts, `max(sibling_mass /
subtree_mass)` per depth. Takes `&self`, rayon-parallel across
  trees, preserves the frozen-baseline promise exactly (zero
  reservoir churn). Aggregate AUC 0.763 on NAB, 0.751 on
  TSB-AD-M — ~0.01-0.02 below the mutating variant, ~12×
  faster on NAB (1.09 s full corpus vs 12.6 s).
- `score_codisp_many` / `score_codisp_stateless_many` — batched
  variants. The mutating `_many` pre-inserts all probes, shares
  the walk cache, then bulk-deletes (saturates reservoir past
  batch ≥ sample_size). The stateless `_many` maps over probes
  in parallel, handles arbitrary batch sizes, zero drift.
- `score_and_attribution` — fused single-walk producing
  `(AnomalyScore, DiVector)` — ~40 % faster than calling
  `score` + `attribution` back-to-back.
- `score_with_confidence` — mean + per-tree dispersion
  (`stddev`, `stderr`), `ci95()` / `ci(z)` helpers for Gaussian
  confidence intervals.
- `score_many_locality_sorted` + `locality_bucket` — opt-in
  cache-aware batch scoring (sort by quantised leading-dim key,
  score, un-permute). Wins only on strongly-correlated batches;
  do not swap blindly — bench your workload.
- `DynamicForest<MAX_D>` (`dynamic_forest`) — runtime-dim wrapper
  for heterogeneous multi-tenant / MSSP deployments. Zero-pads
  inputs shorter than `MAX_D`; preserves the const-generic
  hot-path semantics.
- `SageEstimator<D>` (`sage`) — Monte-Carlo permutation-sampling
  Shapley attribution (Covert NeurIPS 2020). Interaction-aware
  alternative to the marginal `DiVector` attribution.
- `LshAlertClusterer` (`lsh_cluster`) — O(1) bucket-hash
  alternative to the cosine-similarity `AlertClusterer`. Scales
  to MSSP-volume alert streams.
- `PlattCalibrator::update_online` — SGD step per labelled
  observation. Refine an existing batch fit as feedback
  accumulates.
- `FeedbackStore<D>` + `FeedbackLabel` (`feedback` module) —
  SOC-analyst-label ingestion (Das et al. `arXiv:1708.09441`).
  Analyst labels (`Benign` / `Confirmed`) fold into a bounded
  ledger; `adjust(probe, raw_score)` returns a Gaussian-kernel-
  weighted adjustment (Benign pulls down, Confirmed pushes up),
  forest untouched. Lightweight alternative to full AAD per-leaf
  weight learning — swap in later if AUC gap justifies.
- `AdwinDetector` + `DriftAwareForest` (`adwin` + `drift_aware`
  modules) — ADWIN adaptive-window change-point detector (Bifet
  SDM 2007) + shadow-forest swap policy for drift recovery.
  Closes the "PSI fires Alert but baseline stays stale" gap: on
  trigger, spawn a shadow forest; swap atomically after
  `shadow_warmup` observations. `min_primary_age` anti-flap guard.
- `PotDetector` + `fisher_combine` (`univariate_spot` +
  `ensemble` modules) — streaming Peaks-Over-Threshold univariate
  bank (Siffer KDD 2017) + Fisher's p-value combination for joint
  anomaly signal across K feature dims. Orthogonal ensemble head
  to catch per-dim marginal drift that isolation depth misses on
  heterogeneously-distributed multivariate features.
- `ShingledForest<D>` — scalar-stream wrapper with internal
  ring-buffer shingling. Captures temporal autocorrelation that
  bare isolation depth misses on periodic / dwell / beaconing
  signals. Matches the shape of AWS Java `RotateShingle`; fixes
  NAB `rogue_agent_key_hold` / SWaT contextual-anomaly floors.
- `hot_path` module — eBPF-ingress building blocks:
  `UpdateSampler` (stride / per-flow-hash 1-in-N admission, with
  `new_keyed` variant using a 128-bit `getrandom` secret to
  defeat MITRE ATLAS `AML.T0020` reservoir-poisoning sprays),
  bounded MPSC `channel::<D>(cap)` returning
  `(UpdateProducer, UpdateConsumer)` for classifier/updater
  thread split with drop-on-full counter, `PrefixRateCap`
  fixed-bucket per-prefix admission cap,
  `RandomCutForest::score_trimmed` robust ensemble aggregator.
  Full adversarial threat model in `docs/threat_model.md`.

Deliberately absent from `anomstream-core` (out of scope for streaming
network anomaly detection):

- Density estimation (AWS `density()`)
- Forecasting (AWS `RCFCaster`)
- Near-neighbor list (AWS `near_neighbor_list()`)
- Internal shingling + rotation
- GLAD locally adaptive variant
- Label / Attribute generics (`AugmentedRCF`)

## `parallel` and dedicated thread pool

Enable `parallel` to run per-tree work on rayon workers. Pin a
dedicated pool via `ForestBuilder::num_threads` to isolate the
forest from the rest of the application's rayon workload:

```rust,ignore
let forest = ForestBuilder::<16>::new()
    .num_trees(100)
    .sample_size(256)
    .num_threads(4)
    .build()?;
```

`num_threads` is only honoured with `--features parallel`.
